# AvoChat - Instant Messenger Application

## But why is it called AvoChat?

Look at the name of the repository :)

## How do I run this locally?

We are assuming that Node.js, the open-source and cross-platform Javascript runtime environment is installed in your computer. If it is not installed, please follow this [link to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) first before continuing onto the next steps.

Have you Node.js already? Good! This means that we can use the Node.js package manager, also known as npm for the following steps.

### Client Side (AvoChat Frontend)

For the client, we need to navigate to the client directory, that is '../client'. Then run the following command

### `npm install`

This downloads all the packages that are necessary for the operation of AvoChat's frontend.

Now, to actually run the frontend, run the following command:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view AvoChat in your browser.

### Server Side (AvoChat Backend)

For the server, we need to navigate to the server directory, that is '../server'. Then run the following command

### `npm install`

This downloads all the packages that are necessary for the operation of AvoChat's backend.

Now, to actually run the backend, run the following command:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see the AvoChat server in your browser (although, this only displays "Hello World").
